# Welcome to this template

This is a [`jupyter-book`](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html)-based template for creating course notes and websites. 
If you are not familiar with `jupyter-book`, I recommend skimming through their tutorial [here](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/your-first-book.html).
This template shows off a number of features one can use in creating lecture notes/websites.
However, to get detailed information, check out the linked references, including
