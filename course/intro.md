# Welcome to this template

This is a [`jupyter-book`](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html)-based template for creating course notes and websites. More specifically, this template aims to:
- Provide a quick overview of `jupyter-book`,
- Guide you on how to create a new course or update it to the latest template,
- Show how course content could be created with [Markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/file-types/markdown.html) and [MyST Markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/file-types/myst-notebooks.html) (or with [notebooks](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/file-types/notebooks.html)),
- Present the above in the form of HTML (or PDF).
- Exemplify different Sphinx capabilities or other packages that may come in useful.
This instructions repository itself is built on top of the template!

If you are not familiar with `jupyter-book`, I recommend skimming through their tutorial [here](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/your-first-book.html).

To go through the contents of this repository, you can either browse the source files in the `course` directory manually, or build the website following the instructions in `readme.md`.
