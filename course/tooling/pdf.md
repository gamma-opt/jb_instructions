# Building a PDF

With the default options, the PDF output is not perfect.
For example, margins and code-blocks/cells have a lot of space for improvement, and admonitions could use some coloring.
It is possible to customize these and more via the [Sphinx LaTeX options](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/latex.html).

It would make things easier to have access to the LaTeX styling of a pre-existing good looking document.
For example, I tried to find something like that for the Algorithms for Optimization book, but the authors have not made it available, as far as I could tell.
