# MyST and Sphinx

There are a lot of features that may come up when designing notes/webpages.
In writing this template so far, I've used notes on margins, highlighted text (also called admonitions) and synced tabs.
These are often implemented via roles and directives. Which are inline or block-level instructions respectively.

See [here](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/interactive/interactive.html) for a more detailed explanation, [here](https://mystmd.org/guide/directives#directive-admonition) for examples in MyST and [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html) for Sphinx.
Lastly, see [here](https://mystmd.org/guide/) for more MyST features in general.
