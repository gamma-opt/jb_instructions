```{margin}
It looks like in the source file, the margin should be typed before the main content is should be next to. This should be by a bunch of equalities.
```

\begin{align}
a_{11}& =b_{11}&
  a_{12}& =b_{12}\\
a_{21}& =b_{21}&
  a_{22}& =b_{22}+c_{22}
\end{align}


Here is an optimization problem:


```{margin}
This is Equation (1.5) in Algorithms for Optimization.
```

\begin{align*}
\min_{x_1,x_2} \quad& f(x_1,x_2) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad& x_1\geq 0 \\
& x_2 \geq 0 \\
& x_1+x_2 \leq 0
\end{align*}
